How to interact with the map:

The Tableau Link should direct the user to the base map, on the map, if the user hovers to the colored countries, they can see the the job title with the highest average salary.

The map has drop-down bars to the right, which lets the users interact with it using the filter function.

The user can filter by education level, by job title, or they can filter the jobs by salary amount. The interactive element should be very simple.
